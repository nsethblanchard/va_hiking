POSSIBLE FLOW

-user welcomed to va_hiking
-user is asked what type of hiking they are interested in
    -given numbered options, pick a number and make sure number is within range
    -user is prompted with "such and such" is your choice, correct?
    -user says yes or no

option A (easier??)
    -user is shown a list of cities (scraped from each hiking type)
    -user picks city they want to hike near (numbered list based on website "nearest cities" section within each hike type)
    -user is given data for closest hikes

option B 
    -user is prompted to put in a zip (would need to have all zips in VA available in memory and can only pick valid?)
    -user is then given closest hikes based on coordinates (will have to figure out how to have scope of coords from each zip and then find closest???)
    -prints out hiking options

d. What classes will you be using? 
e. How will you display data one level deep to the user?

MAKING THE STORY
